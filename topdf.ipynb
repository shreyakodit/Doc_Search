      "for an accident or someone else may be.  An accident may happen in \n",

The exact terms and \\nconditions are explained in the following pages. \\nThere are two basic categories of insurance described in this policy, \\nCompulsory Insurance and Optional Insurance. \\nThere are four Parts to Compulsory Insurance.

Some of them extend \\nthe coverage or the amounts of protection provided by Compulsory \\nInsurance.  Some of them provide protection not found in Compulsory \\nInsurance.  You do not have to buy any of these eight Parts if you do \\nnot want to. \\nAuto insurance claims arise in hundreds of different ways.  Autos are \\nsometimes stolen or damaged.  Accidents may injure people in your \\nauto, people in other autos or pedestrians.  You may be responsible \\nfor an accident or someone else may be.  An accident may happen in \\nMassachusetts or out of state.  Different situations require different \\nkinds of insurance. \\nPlease read the whole policy to see what kinds of insurance are \\navailable to cover these different situations.

Each coverage you \\npurchased will show a premium charge next to it.  If no premium \\ncharge is shown, you do not have that coverage. \\nSometimes you and we will agree to change this policy.  The only way \\nthat can be done is by an “Endorsement” added to the basic policy \\nform.  All endorsements must be in writing.  They then become part of \\nthis policy. \\nWe are pleased to have you as a customer and hope you have a safe \\nand accident-free year. But if you need us, we are here to help you.  If \\nyou have an accident or loss, or if someone sues you, contact your \\nagent or us. \\nDo the same if you have any questions or complaints.
